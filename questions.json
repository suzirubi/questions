    "notes": "As a concerned member of a long line of revered Bells (my grandfather - Liber T. Bell - is retired and currently living in Philadelphia), I have always wondered why so many amature poets tend to use such a horrifying concept coupled with our illustrious last name. We usually take cruises to escape this prejudice. Now we can't even do that.",

Anyway, I have heard the threat that if a caller is disconnected they will cut of this part of the operator's anatomy. I hope there are social services for threatened operators.",
